## 🏃‍♂️ My journey


This project was my first experience with styled components and the react context api. At the same time, I learned about fake APIs and custom hooks, which are two common patterns in front-end development.

With that said, nowadays I write better code and would use different libraries, but at the end of the day my past self still nailed it 😁
